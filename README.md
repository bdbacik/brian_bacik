# Data Science Portfolio
This is a collection of projects I've completed over the years highlighting skills across the data science spectrum including data wrangling, hypothesis testing, database management, visualization, machine learning and deep learning. 


## [Harris SAVES Covid-19 Research Project](https://harrissaves.org/)
* Research project led by UTHealth School of Public Health in partnership with Baylor College of Medicine and Harris County Public Health.
* Through this research project, we provide FREE TESTING FOR EVERYONE (including children) in Harris County, even if you are not sick, and regardless of gender, race, income or immigration status.
* My responsibilities include data architecture, collection, cleaning, analytics, and visualization.
* [Public dashboard linked here](https://sph.uth.edu/projects/harris-saves/dashboard)

## [Using Machine Learning to Predict Customer Churn](https://github.com/bdbacik/Predicting-Customer-Churn)
* Built classification model to predict churn of credit card customers for a bank.
* Optimized Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost with grid search cross validation.
* Introduced novel modeling approach with random undersampling, tomek link elimination, and xgboost bagging to to achieve better positive class Recall on noisy, * label imbalanced data.
* Conducted ROI analyis by considering customer lifetime value (LTV), cost of false positives/negatives, and cost of intervention to retain customers.
* Presented recommendation for final model and summarized learnings for similar problems.
